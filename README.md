# SPD software

This repository contains software project devoted to the [SPD](http://spd.jinr.ru/doku.php)
 experiment at the [NICA](http://nica.jinr.ru) collider. SPD strongly profits from, recognizes the value of, and supports open source software. By committing code to a SPD repository the right to be recognized as original author is granted and the author allows the members of the collaboration to use and modify it. An SPD repository can be declared public if all contributors agree that it can be distributed under an open source license. By committing code to a public SPD repository contributors agree to the publication of their code and affirm compliance with the code of conduct. The copyright remains with the contributors
