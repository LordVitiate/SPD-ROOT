Run reconstruction testECAL.sh, the recommended number of events is 20'000, but for some checks
the ten times larger statistics is required.

Figures for photon reconstruction are in CheckReconstruction. The relevant ones are:
  * "final/h_ediff_etrue_barrel" and "final/h_ediff_etrue_endcap" represent the difference between
    the true and reconstructed energies; 1-2% difference is Ok;
  * "final/h_ereco_MCenergy_energyDisc_PE_graph" - energy resolution for all angles together;
  * "final/h_ereco_MCenergy_energyDisc_PE_angleBin0_graph_combined" - energy resolution as a function
    of angle, requires 200K+ events;
  * "final/h_phidiff_MCenergy_energyDisc_graph" - R*phi resolution, should decrease with increase of energy;
  * "endcap0_xy_cells" and "endcap1_xy_cells" - fired cells, controll ECal shape an the whole size;
  * "h_allpart_z" - Z-coordinate of reconstructed particles, check symmetry;
  * "hEndcapID" - endcap ID, check that both of them work;
  * "h_xdiff_xtrue" and "h_ydiff_ytrue" - coordinate resolution for endcaps, check absence of notable bias.

Figures for pion reconstruction are in CheckReconstructionPi0. The relevant ones are:
  * "h_mgg_doublebarrel", "h_mgg_doublebarrel_100mevMin", "h_mgg_doublebarrel_400mevMin" - pi0 mass when
    both photons hit barrel, the most important is h_mgg_doublebarrel_400mevMin;
  * "h_mgg_doubleendcap", "h_mgg_doubleendcap_100mevMin", "h_mgg_doubleendcap_400mevMin" - the same for
    endcaps;
  * "h_pi0reconstruction_vs_thetaPi0_passed_ratio" - the reconstruction efficiency as a function of
    the polar angle, should be reasonably flat.
